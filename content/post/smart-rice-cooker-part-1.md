title: Smart Rice Cooker Conversion - Part 1
---

The "why" isn't important (read "doesn't exist"), but I want to take a regular (dumb) rice cooker, and convert it into a "smart" rice cooker.

So, a whim and a few minutes on Aliexpress later, my pint sized rice cooker and an assortment of electronics are on the slow boat from China.

List of things:

- Rice cooker
- (http://ali.onl/128Q)[Thermistors] ($2.97 - 100pcs, for temperature readings)

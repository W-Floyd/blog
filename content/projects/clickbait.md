This project was completed in the Fall Semester of 2019, for my EPM class at LeTourneau University.

***

The mandate given to us was as follows:

Create a device to launch a fishing weight. It must:

* be capable of selectively launching 20 and 40 feet
* weight less than 5 pounds
* cost less than $100
* be battery powered
* (for extra credit) be wirelessly controlled

I was assigned as an engineering lead, and as it turned out, completed the majority of the physical project.
This was a mutual arrangement, however - I bounced ideas off of team members as needed, and provided information needed for the report writing - they completed the report and peripheral tasks, and helped me as I found tasks that could be assigned.
Being a small project of such singular focus, there was little in the way of division possible on tasks, not without loss of efficiency.

And so it was that we began brainstorming.

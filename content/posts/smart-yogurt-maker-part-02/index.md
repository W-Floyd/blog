In [Part 1](../smart-yogurt-maker-part-01) I got my rice cooker reporting temperature and roughly maintaining a set-point, producing my first batch of yogurt.
Now follows a tale of Accidents, Averages, and Algorithms (sorta).

# An accident has occurred

How prophetic...
My last post said so truly that I needed to "ensure the outlet will turn off if the ESP8266 loses connection".
Of course, I couldn't help myself and tried making a new batch before fixing this.
So it came to be that 6 hours into a batch of yogurt, it was unceremoniously boiled for a full hour.

At first, all hope was lost - the mess of solidified dairy mocked me from the teflon lining of my dear rice cooker.
As I forlornly drained the whey, I figured I'd give it a taste...
After all, it had been boiled to death, it couldn't possibly hurt me?

# Rice $\rightarrow$ Yogurt $\rightarrow$ Cheese?

I had in fact made cheese.
Not at all intentionally, and not very well (it was still somewhat yogurt-sour), but it was undeniably cheese.
